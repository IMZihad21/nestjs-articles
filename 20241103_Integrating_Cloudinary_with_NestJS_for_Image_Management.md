In this article, we will explore how to integrate Cloudinary into a NestJS application for effective image management. We will begin by setting up the `CloudinaryProvider` and then break down the `ImageMetaService` into manageable fragments to better understand its functionalities.

## 1. Setting Up the Cloudinary Provider

The `CloudinaryProvider` is responsible for configuring the Cloudinary API with your credentials. This setup allows your application to interact with Cloudinary for image uploads and management.

```typescript
import { Provider } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";
import { v2 as CloudinaryAPI } from "cloudinary";

export const CLOUDINARY = "CLOUDINARY";

export const CloudinaryProvider: Provider = {
  provide: CLOUDINARY,
  useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => {
    return CloudinaryAPI.config({
      cloud_name: configService.get<string>("CLD_CLOUD_NAME"),
      api_key: configService.get<string>("CLD_API_KEY"),
      api_secret: configService.get<string>("CLD_API_SECRET"),
    });
  },
  inject: [ConfigService], // Inject the ConfigService
};
```

### Explanation

- The provider uses the `ConfigService` to securely fetch Cloudinary credentials from the environment variables.
- It configures Cloudinary with `cloud_name`, `api_key`, and `api_secret` to establish a connection with the Cloudinary service.

## 2. The ImageMetaService Class

Next, we define the `ImageMetaService` class, which will handle all image-related operations, such as uploading and deleting images.

```typescript
import {
  BadRequestException,
  HttpException,
  Injectable,
  InternalServerErrorException,
  Logger,
} from "@nestjs/common";
import { ImageMetaRepository } from "./image-meta.repository";

@Injectable()
export class ImageMetaService {
  private readonly logger: Logger = new Logger(ImageMetaService.name);

  constructor(private readonly imageMetaRepository: ImageMetaRepository) {}
}
```

### Explanation

- The `@Injectable()` decorator allows the service to be injected into other components.
- A logger instance is created for logging errors and operational messages.
- The `ImageMetaRepository` is injected for interacting with the image metadata in the database.

## 3. Creating a Single Image

The `createSingleImage` method handles the uploading of a single image to Cloudinary and storing its metadata in the repository.

```typescript
async createSingleImage(singleImageFile: Express.Multer.File, ownerId: string): Promise<ImageMetaDocument> {
  try {
    if (!singleImageFile) {
      throw new BadRequestException("No image file provided");
    }

    const extension = this.getFileExtension(singleImageFile.originalname);
    const uploadResult = await this.uploadImageToCloudinary(singleImageFile);

    const singleImage = await this.imageMetaRepository.create({
      url: uploadResult.secure_url,
      name: uploadResult.public_id,
      extension: extension,
      size: singleImageFile.size,
      mimeType: singleImageFile.mimetype,
      ownerId: ownerId,
    });

    return singleImage;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Error creating single image:`, error);
    if (error instanceof HttpException) {
      throw error;
    } else {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException("Failed to create single image");
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- Checks if an image file is provided, throwing a `BadRequestException` if not.
- Retrieves the file extension and uploads the image to Cloudinary.
- Saves the image metadata in the repository, including the secure URL, public ID, size, and MIME type.
- Logs errors and handles exceptions gracefully.


## 4. Creating Multiple Images

The `createMultipleImages` method allows uploading of multiple images at once.

```typescript
async createMultipleImages(multipleImageFiles: Express.Multer.File[], ownerId: string): Promise<ImageMetaDocument[]> {
  try {
    if (!multipleImageFiles || multipleImageFiles.length === 0) {
      throw new BadRequestException("No image files provided");
    }

    const multipleImages = await Promise.all(
      multipleImageFiles.map(async (image) => await this.createSingleImage(image, ownerId)),
    );

    return multipleImages;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Error creating multiple images:`, error);
    if (error instanceof HttpException) {
      throw error;
    } else {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException("Failed to create multiple images");
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation

- Validates the presence of image files and throws a `BadRequestException` if none are provided.
- Uses `Promise.all` to concurrently process multiple image uploads, calling `createSingleImage` for each file.
- Handles errors in a similar fashion to the single image creation method.

## 5. Removing an Image

The `removeImage` method is responsible for deleting an image from Cloudinary and the database.

```typescript
async removeImage(imageId: string, ownerId: string): Promise<ImageMetaDocument | null> {
  try {
    const deletedImage = await this.imageMetaRepository.getOneWhere({
      _id: imageId,
      ownerId: ownerId,
    });

    if (!deletedImage) {
      throw new Error(`Could not find image with id: ${imageId}`);
    }

    await this.deleteImageFromCloudinary(deletedImage.name);
    await this.imageMetaRepository.removeOneById(imageId);

    return deletedImage;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof HttpException) throw error;

    this.logger.error(`Error deleting image:`, error);
    throw new InternalServerErrorException("Could not delete image");
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- Retrieves the image metadata based on the provided `imageId` and `ownerId`.
- Throws an error if the image is not found.
- Deletes the image from Cloudinary and the local repository, logging errors appropriately.

## 6. Uploading Images to Cloudinary

The `uploadImageToCloudinary` method manages the upload process to Cloudinary.

```typescript
async uploadImageToCloudinary(file: Express.Multer.File): Promise<UploadApiResponse> {
  return new Promise<UploadApiResponse>((resolve, reject) => {
    const uploadStream = CloudinaryAPI.uploader.upload_stream(
      (error: UploadApiErrorResponse | undefined, result: UploadApiResponse | undefined) => {
        if (error) {
          this.logger.error(`Failed to upload image to Cloudinary`, error);
          reject(error);
        } else if (!result) {
          const errorMessage = "Upload result is undefined";
          this.logger.error(`Failed to upload image to Cloudinary: ${errorMessage}`);
          reject(new Error(errorMessage));
        } else {
          resolve(result);
        }
      },
    );

    const stream = toStream(file.buffer);
    stream.pipe(uploadStream);
  });
}
```

### Explanation

- Utilizes a stream to upload the image to Cloudinary.
- Resolves the promise with the upload result or rejects it with an error, logging any issues encountered during the upload process.

## 7. Deleting Images from Cloudinary

The `deleteImageFromCloudinary` method facilitates the removal of images from Cloudinary.

```typescript
async deleteImageFromCloudinary(publicId: string): Promise<DeleteApiResponse> {
  try {
    return await CloudinaryAPI.uploader.destroy(publicId);
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Failed to delete image from Cloudinary with public ID: ${publicId}`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- Deletes an image using its public ID and handles any errors by logging them.

## 8. Utility Function for File Extension

The getFileExtension method extracts the file extension from the original filename.

```typescript
private getFileExtension(originalName: string): string {
  const lastDotIndex = originalName?.lastIndexOf(".");
  return lastDotIndex === -1 ? "" : originalName?.slice(lastDotIndex + 1);
}
```

### Explanation

- Retrieves the last index of the dot in the filename to determine the extension, returning an empty string if no extension is found.

## 9. Setting Up the ImageMetaModule

The `ImageMetaModule` consolidates the `ImageMetaService`, and `CloudinaryProvider`, enabling their usage throughout your NestJS application.

```typescript
import { Global, Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { CloudinaryProvider } from "../../utility/provider/cloudinary.provider";
import { ImageMetaService } from "./image-meta.service";

@Global()
@Module({
  imports: [],
  providers: [ImageMetaService, CloudinaryProvider],
  exports: [ImageMetaService],
})
export class ImageMetaModule {}
```

### Explanation

- The `@Global()` decorator makes the module globally available throughout the application, which is useful for shared services.
